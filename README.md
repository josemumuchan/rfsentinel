RF Sentinel is a companion tool made primarily for MAU users, developed with Claude AI, to protect your character during AFK farming sessions. Stop worrying about returning to a destroyed MAU.

## ✨ Core Protection Features

### 🤖 MAU Destruction Prevention 💥
Automatically monitors mounted health. If HP drops critically, the tool instantly triggers '**Take Off**' (dismount) to save your MAU from **destruction**.

### 🧙‍♀️ F9 Key ❄️
Detects critical health and immediately uses the "**F9**" skill.

## 🪛How to Use (v1.0.0):
1. Make sure you are already logged into your character.
2. Select RF Process from the dropdown menu:<br>
