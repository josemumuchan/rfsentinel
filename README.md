RF Sentinel is a companion tool made primarily for MAU users, developed with Claude AI, to protect your character during AFK farming sessions. Stop worrying about returning to a destroyed MAU.

## ✨ Core Protection Features

### 🤖MAU Explosion Prevention 💥
Automatically monitors mounted health. If HP drops critically, the tool instantly triggers '**Take Off**' (dismount) to save your MAU from **destruction**.

### 🧙‍♀️ Mage Class Freeze ❄️
Detects critical health and immediately uses the "**Freeze**" skill, granting temporary invulnerability.

## 🪛How to Use:
1. Select RF Online process
2. Ride your MAU
3. Press '**START**'

*RF Sentinel was developed using AI-assisted scripting via Claude.ai, blending deep RF Online utility with modern technology.*
